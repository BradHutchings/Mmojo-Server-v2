## 520. APE Builds
### About this Step
In the following two steps, we will build Mmojo Server (`mmojo-server`) and other llama.cpp targets as Actual Portable Executable (APEs). These exexcutables run on x86_64 and aarch64 (arm64) across Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, and some other operating systems. They do not offer GPU support.
- **Compatible** builds run on a wide range of x86_64 and aarch64 processors.
- **Performant** builds run on newer x86_64 processors and Apple M* aarch64 processors.

**Where:** Perform this step in either or both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

### SHORTCUT: Build Compatible and Performant APEs
Before using this shortcut, please work through the steps of building the compatible and performant APEs a few times so that you can become familiar with what they do.
```
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh X86_64 compatible
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh aarch64 compatible
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh compatible
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh X86_64 performant
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh aarch64 performant
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh performant
```

### SHORTCUT: Test Compatible APE Mmojo Server
After you build all the APEs, you can test the compatible APE:
```
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Test-Cosmo-APE.sh compatible command-line $TEST_WITH_CHAT_UI
```

---
### SHORTCUT: Test Performant APE Mmojo Server
After you build all the APEs, you can test the performant APE:
```
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Test-Cosmo-APE.sh performant command-line $TEST_WITH_CHAT_UI
```
