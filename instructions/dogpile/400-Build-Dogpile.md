## 400. Build Dogpile
### About Dogpile
**Dogpile** is an example of a branded developer experience.

I'm working on some very minor customization details like the process name reported to the operating system and the name of the support directory. If you'd like to become a sponsor of Mmojo Server, this is a zero-work on your part branding opportunity.

### About this Section
We're ready to build `dogpile` executables. First, we'll build a native version for the build environment platfrom that can be used to test features and changes. Then, we'll build an Actually Portable Executable (APE) with Cosmopolitan that will run anywhere.
