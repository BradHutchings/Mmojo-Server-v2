## 410. Build APEs
### About this Step
In the following two steps, we will build the Dogpile server (`dogpile`) and other llama.cpp targets as Actual Portable Executable (APEs). These exexcutables run on x86_64 and aarch64 (arm64) across Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, and some other operating systems. They do not offer GPU support.
- **Compatible** builds run on a wide range of x86_64 and aarch64 processors.
- **Performant** builds run on newer x86_64 processors and Apple M* aarch64 processors.

**Where:** Perform this step in either or both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

### SHORTCUT: Build Compatible and Performant APEs
Before using this shortcut, please work through the steps of building the compatible and performant APEs a few times so that you can become familiar with what they do.
```
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/410-Build-with-Cosmo.sh X86_64 compatible dogpile
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/410-Build-with-Cosmo.sh aarch64 compatible dogpile
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/410-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh compatible dogpile
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/410-Build-with-Cosmo.sh X86_64 performant dogpile
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/410-Build-with-Cosmo.sh aarch64 performant dogpile
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/410-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh performant dogpile
```
