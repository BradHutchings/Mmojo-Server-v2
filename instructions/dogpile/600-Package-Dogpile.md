## 600. Package Dogpile
### About Dogpile
**Dogpile** is an example of a branded developer experience. You can build Mmojo Server without the Mmojo Server customizations like Mmojo Complete and SSL certificates, and package it in an APE file of a different name. I'm working on some very minor customization details like the process name reported to the operating system and the name of the support directory. If you'd like to become a sponsor of Mmojo Server, this is a zero-work on your part branding opportunity.

If you're wondering about the name...

### About this Section
Now that you have Dogpile built as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file, you can package it for deployment.

---
### Package Dogpile
Here are some packaging options:
- [611. Package APE (Compatible)](611-Package-APE-Compatible.md) - Package Dogpile as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file, which can run on several operating systems spanning x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM64) arcitectures. The "compatible" APE runs (slowly) on a wide variery of x86_64 and aarch64 (arm64) machines.
- [612. Package APE (Performant)](612-Package-APE-Performant.md) - Package Dogpile as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file, which can run on several operating systems spanning x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM64) arcitectures. The "performant" APE runs faster, but only on later model x86_64 machines and high end aarch64 (arm64) machines like Apple's M*-based Macs.

**Get Started:** [611. Package APE (Compatible)](611-Package-APE-Compatible.md)
