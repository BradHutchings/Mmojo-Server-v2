## 1400. Build Dogpile
### About this Section
**This is an experimental section for a differently branded version without the UI customizations. It probably does not work.**

We're ready to build `dogpile` executables. First, we'll build a native version for the build environment platfrom that can be used to test features and changes. Then, we'll build an Actually Portable Executable (APE) with Cosmopolitan that will run anywhere.

### Build Dogpile
Here are the things you need to do:
- [1401. Prepare to Build](1401-Prepare-to-Build.md) - Clone llama.cpp repo, fix some things, and copy some things.
- [1402. Prepare to Test](1402-Prepare-to-Test.md) - Set some environment variables to customize test runs.
- [1403. Build Debug](1403-Build-Debug.md) - Build an unoptimized `mmojo-server` for the CPU of the build environment platformm that can be used to test features and changes.
- [1404. Build APE](1404-Build-APE.md) - Build `mmojo-server-ape` as an Actually Portable Executable (APE) with Cosmopolitan.

**Get Started:** [1401. Prepare to Build](1401-Prepare-to-Build.md)
