## 401. Download Models

### About this Step
In this step, we will download some `gguf` files we will need from Hugging Face and copy them to our Mmojo share for later use.

If you would like to convert some Hugging Face models, please proceed to [402. Prepare to Convert](402-Prepare-to-Convert.md).

**Where:** Perform this step in both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

**Shortcut:** [Scroll down](#shortcut-download-models).

### Create Models Directory
This script creates the `$MODELS_DIR` and adds a simple model map to it:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/401-Create-Models-Directory.sh" target="_blank">401-Create-Models-Directory.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script. We run with `.` so variables can be defined and exported.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Create-Models-Directory.sh
  ```

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Download Model Map.</b></summary>

If you plan to create `mmojo-server-one` Actual Portable Executables (APEs) with embedded models, you should download some models that are tested to work with `mmojo-server`. We'll download a model map from Hugging Face.

This script downloads the model map from Hugging Face:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/401-Download-Model-Map.sh" target="_blank">401-Download-Model-Map.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Download-Model-Map.sh
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Edit the Model Map.</b></summary>

All these models will take a long time to download, so you can edit the model map and remove models you don't want.
```
nano $MODEL_MAP
```
</details>

### Download Models
This script downloads the models from Hugging Face:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/301-Download-Models.sh" target="_blank">301-Download-Models.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/301-Download-Models.sh
  ```

### SHORTCUT: Download Models
I really think you should run through these scripts one at a time the first few times you build, so you can familiarize yourself with the process and know what goes where. But, now that you've run through a few times, you can use the shortcut snippet to download two models I offer on Hugging Face.

### SHORTCUT: Download Tested Models
I really think you should run through these scripts one at a time the first few times you build, so you can familiarize yourself with the process and know what goes where. But, now that you've run through a few times, you can use the shortcut snippet to download all the models I offer on Hugging Face. This will take awhile and use a lot (i.e. 100 GB-ish) of disk space.
