## 206. Create Mmojo Share

---
### About the Step
The Mmojo Share is a file share where I keep files for local access and completed builds. It lets me build different items on different build platforms. I use a Ubuntu 24.04 virtual machine to build and test x86_64 and cosmo builds. I use a Raspberry Pi for building and testing ARM64 and Pi specific builds. The Mmojo Share lets me keep .gguf models to test with locally and is where I copy completed and packaged builds. Your Mmojo Share will help you organize your builds as well.

In this step, we will create a Mmojo Share on a device running Linuz. We will install the necessary SMB software, configure `smb.conf`, restart the SMB server, and set it to start automatically at system startup. You can perform this step on another computer on your network if you like.

If you have a Mmojo Share already set up, skip ahead to the next step: [206. Mount Mmojo Share](206-Mount-Mmojo-Share.md).

**Where:** Perform this step on a computer on your network reachable by other build environments on your network.

### Enable File Sharing and Create Mmojo Share &mdash; Windows 10/11
If you plan to build in a WSL enivoronment, setting up your Mmojo Share on the host computer is a good approach.

Here is a good video that shows how to enable file sharing and create an SMB share on Windows 10 and 11.

The video's recommendation to turn password protected sharing off may be workable for a private home network. If you do this, you won't have to manage users for the SMB share.

### Install Samba and Create Mmojo Share &mdash; Ubuntu and other Debian Linux
Here is the official Ubunutu tutorial for installing Samba and creating a share.

If you're building in your WSL environment, that is not a good place to set up a file share because you will likely rebuild that encvironment from scratch often. You want a place that can hold the files you keep permanently.

### Create Directories on Mmojo Share
Make the directories we'll use.
