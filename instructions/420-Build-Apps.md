## 420. Build APEs
### About this Step
This is a placeholder for an introduction to building Apps. We'll have shortcut here for choosing GPUs, then building compatible, perfortmant, and native apps. We'll talk about how we build all the llama.cpp targets as executables for the build platform.

**Where:** Perform this step in either or both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments. The resulting APE file will be copied to your Mmojo SMB share.

**Shortcut:** [Scroll down](#shortcut-build-and-assemble-ape-test-ape).
