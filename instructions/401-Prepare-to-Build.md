## 401. Prepare to Build
### About this Step

In this step, we will clone this Mmojo-Server repo, fix problems that affect building with Cosmopolitan, and add some features for Mmojo Server.

**Where:** Perform this step in both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

**Shortcut:** [Scroll down](#shortcut-run-all-the-above-scripts).

<details>
  <summary><b>Update Local Mmojo Server Repo</b> &mdash; Expand if you haven't today.</summary>
  
Have you updated your local clone of the Mmojo Server Repo today? If not, run this first:
```
mm-update-local-mmojo-server-repo.sh
. mm-environment-variables.sh
```
</details>

### Clone Repos
Clone llama.cpp repo and repos upon which it depends into a `$BUILD_LLAMA_CPP_DIR` directory.

This script clones the llama.cpp repo and repos upon which it depends into the `$BUILD_LLAMA_CPP_DIR` directory:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/401-Clone-Repos.sh" target="_blank">401-Clone-Repos.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script. We run with `.` so variables can be defined and exported.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Clone-Repos.sh
  ```

---
### Patch llama.cpp Source Code and Build Code
This looks like lots of fun.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/401-Fix-llama-cpp.sh" target="_blank">401-Fix-llama-cpp.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Fix-llama-cpp.sh
  ```

---
### Customize WebUI
#### Suggested
Rollback the `tools/server/webui` to the pre-Svelte version. The new Svelte UI doesn't like running on non-root web server path. We'll remove this step when the new UI is fixed upstream in llama.cpp.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/401-Rollback-webui.sh" target="_blank">401-Rollback-webui.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Rollback-webui.sh
  ```

#### Required
Customize the web UI, rebuild all the web files. If you did the **Suggested** step above, you will see 2 `sed` errors.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/401-Customize-webui.sh" target="_blank">401-Customize-webui.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Customize-webui.sh
  ```
#### Uh. Oh. npm Spit Out Errors

You may have an earlier version of `npm` and `nodejs` installed on your build machine than are required
for that customization step. If you're running Linux or macOS, these steps should clean that up. I am working
to figure out if this it's safe to just put this in the [207. Install Dependencies](../207-Install-Dependencies.md)
step.

**ONLY RUN THESE IF YOU HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PREVIOUS STEP!!** Then rerun the previous step.
```
sudo apt remove nodejs npm -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
sudo npm install -g node@latest
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

### SHORTCUT: Run All the Above Scripts 
I really think you should run through these scripts one at a time the first few times you build, so you can familiarize yourself with the process and know what goes where. But, now that you've run through a few times, you can use the shortcut snippet:
```
################################################################################
# SHORTCUT: DON'T DO THIS IF YOU ALREADY RAN SCRIPTS ABOVE!
################################################################################
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Clone-Repos.sh
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Fix-llama-cpp.sh
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Rollback-webui.sh
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/401-Customize-webui.sh
```

---
### Proceed
- **Next:** [402. Prepare to Test](402-Prepare-to-Test.md)
- **Previous:** This is the first step in this section.
- **Up:** [400. Build Mmojo Server](400-Build-Mmojo-Server.md)
