If you would like to convert some Hugging Face models, please proceed to [410. Convert Models](402-Convert-Models.md).

**Where:** Perform this step in both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

### Restore Models
This script mounts your Mmojo Share, looks for the `/models` subdirectory, and looks the `/models/restore-model-map.txt` file. If that file does not exist, it copies the `/models/model-map.txt` file and comments out models after the first two. You can edit that file to pick which models get restored.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/mm-restore-models.sh" target="_blank">mm-restore-models.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script. We run with `.` so variables can be defined and exported.
  ```
  mm-restore-models.sh
  ```

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Edit the Restore Model Map File</b></summary>
  
You can edit the `restore-model-map.txt` file with this command:
```
nano $MMOJO_SHARE_RESTORE_MODEL_MAP
```
</details>
