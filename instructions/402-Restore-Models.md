### Restore Models
This script mounts your Mmojo Share, looks for the `/models` subdirectory, and looks the `/models/restore-model-map.txt` file. If that file does not exist, it copies the `/models/model-map.txt` file. You can edit that file to pick which models get restored and the order they get restored. The `2` command-line paramter tells the script to restore the first two available models than are not available locally.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/mm-restore-models.sh" target="_blank">mm-restore-models.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*

- Run the script to restore the first two available models than are not available locally.
  ```
  mm-restore-models.sh 2
  ```

  <summary><b>Optional: Edit the Restore Model Map File</b></summary>
  
You can edit the `restore-model-map.txt` file with this command:
```
sudo nano $MMOJO_SHARE_RESTORE_MODEL_MAP
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Delete the Restore Model Map File</b></summary>
  
Deleting the restore model map file will force the `mm-restore-models.sh` script to recreate it. You can delete the `restore-model-map.txt` file with this command:
```
sudo rm $MMOJO_SHARE_RESTORE_MODEL_MAP
```
</details>
