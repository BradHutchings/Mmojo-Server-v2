## 105. Packaging for Deployment
### Packaging for Deployment
I need to expand on these. But I need to get Mmojo Server version 2 out first!

Philosophy:
- It should be easy for any user &mdash; from a developer wanting to work locally with agents to your Mom, who just wants an occasional recipe &mdash; to install software that just works right out of the box.
- It should be easy enough to upgrade to a more performant solution.

Current options:
- APE runs anywhere, contains all support files, not very performant.
- Zip file extracts on OS/architecture, extracts to folder containing everything needed, perfomant (CPU or GPU).

Future options:
- Self-Extracting Application Support (SEAS). Runs on OS/architecture, extracts on first run, performant (CPU or GPU).
