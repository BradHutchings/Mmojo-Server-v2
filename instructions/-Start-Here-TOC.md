## Mmojo Server Instructions &ndash; Table of Contents
The Mmojo Server project is mostly my instructions (aka "documentation"), with lots of functioning scripts to work out the gory details. The instructions are organized to be worked through sequentially from start to finish. I'll tell you what the point of this project is, help you prepare your build environment, gather things you'll need, build Mmojo Server, then package it for deployment. Read the instructions on GitHub. You will be instructed to clone this repo to a specific directory on your build machine(s) later.

You really can't do much with this project without R-ing TFM. So [jump in and read](101-Project-Goals.md)! Then start doing! Links to next topics are at the bottom of each page. Table of Contents is below for your reference.

### [200. Prepare Build Environment](200-Prepare-Build-Environment.md)
Before you can build Mmojo Server, you need a build environment. Depending on what you want to build, it could be a single computer or multiple computers. You should have a separate share on your network to keep files you only need to download once, and keep the products of your builds. You may find yourself rebuilding your build environments regularly, especially if you edit or enhance code and instructions in the repo.

- [201. Prepare WSL](201-Prepare-WSL.md) - Prepare your Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment if you're using one.
- [202. Create Scripts Directory](202-Create-Scripts-Directory.md) - Create `$HOME/mmscripts` directory, then add it to your `$PATH`.
- [203. Clone Mmojo Server Repo](203-Clone-Mmojo-Server-Repo.md) - Clone Mmojo Server Repo for setup and build scripts.
- [204. Set Timezone](204-Set-Timezone.md) - Set your build system's time zone so Completion UI reflects correct build date.
- [205. Create Mmojo Share](205-Create-Mmojo-Share.md) - Create a file share to support multiple build environments.
- [206. Mount Mmojo Share](206-Mount-Mmojo-Share.md) - Mount a file share to support multiple build environments.
- [207. Install Dependencies](207-Install-Dependencies.md) - Install packages needed for your build system.
- [208. mm- Scripts](208-mm-Scripts.md) - All about those `mm-` scripts in your `$HOME/mm-scripts` directory.

### [400. Convert Models](400-Convert-Models.md)
Use llama.cpp to convert models from Hugging Face repositories into `.gguf` files that Mmojo Server can use.
- [401. Prepare to Connvert](401-Prepare-to-Convert.md) - Clone the llama.cpp GitHub repo, and leave it uncustomized so we can convert with it.
- [402. Google Gemma](402-Google-Gemma.md) - Clone Google's Gemma Repos on Hugging Face, convert to `.gguf` models.
- [403. Meta Llama](403-Meta-Llama.md) - Clone Meta's Llama Repos on Hugging Face, convert to `.gguf` models.
- [404. Mistral AI Ministral](404-Mistral-AI-Ministral.md) - Clone Mistral AI's Ministral Repos on Hugging Face, convert to `.gguf` models.
