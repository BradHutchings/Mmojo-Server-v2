## 600. Package Mmojo Server
### About this Section
Now that you have Mmojo Server built as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file, a CPU optimized build for your build system, or a GPU-enabled build for your build system, you can package it for deployment.

(Figure out the naming convention. "Mmojo Server" is APE, "Mmojo Server (OS, Architecture)", "Mmojo Server (Device)")

### Package Mmojo Server
Here are some packaging options:
- [610. Platform Packages](610-Platform-Packages.md) - Package Mmojo Server as a `.zip` file that can be unzipped into a directory containing the Mmojo Server executable and supporting files.<br/><br/>
- [620. APE Packages](620-APE-Packages.md) - Package Mmojo Server as Actual Portable Executable (APE) files, which can run on several operating systems spanning x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM64) arcitectures.
  - [621. APE (Compatible)](621-APE-Compatible.md) - The "compatible" APE runs (slowly) on a wide variery of x86_64 and aarch64 (arm64) machines.
  - [622. APE (Performant)](622-APE-Performant.md) - The "performant" APE runs faster, but only on later model x86_64 machines and high end aarch64 (arm64) machines like Apple's M*-based Macs.
  - [623. Naked APE (Compatible)](623-Naked-APE-Compatible.md) - This is a compatible APE with no `.gguf` file. You can `zip` a `.gguf` file onto it or copy one into the working directory, and it will just find it. No need to update the `mmojo-server-args` file!
  - [624. Naked APE (Performant)](624-Naked-APE-Performant.md) - This is a performant APE with no `.gguf` file. You can `zip` a `.gguf` file onto it or copy one into the working directory, and it will just find it. No need to update the `mmojo-server-args` file!<br/><br/>
