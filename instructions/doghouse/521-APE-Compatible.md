## 521. APE (Compatible)
### About Doghouse
**Doghouse** is an example of a branded developer experience. [Read more about Doghouse](400-Build-Doghouse.md).

### About this Step
In this step, we will build Doghouse for x86_64 and aarch64 (arm64). We will then package them in an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file (`doghouse-ape`) which can run cross platform and cross artchitecture.

The APE will run on x86 and ARM CPUs, and Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. As a zip file, the APE can also hold configuration files and .gguf models. The APE will not perform as well as platform-specifc builds. It does not have the most optimized GGML CPU code and does not use GGML GPU options. Tradeoffs.


**Where:** Perform this step in either or both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

### Build Doghouse for x86_64
This script uses CMake to build Doghouse with `cosmocc` for x86_64. Note that we make a temporary change to `common/CMakeLists.txt` to statically link with OpenSSL libraries.
- View the script: <a href="../../scripts/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh" target="_blank">510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script. We run with `.` so variables can be defined and exported.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh X86_64 compatible doghouse
  ```

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Test the x86_64 Build.</b></summary>

If your build environment is x86_64, you can test this build. Requires previously downloaded model to the `$MODELS_DIR` directory.
- View the script: <a href="../../scripts/510-Test-Cosmo-Build.sh" target="_blank">510-Test-Cosmo-Build.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Test-Cosmo-Build.sh X86_64 compatible 1 doghouse
  ```

### Build Doghouse for aarch64 (arm64)
This script uses CMake to build Doghouse with `cosmocc` for x86_64. Note that we make a temporary change to `common/CMakeLists.txt` to statically link with OpenSSL libraries.
- View the script: <a href="....//scripts/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh" target="_blank">510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script. We run with `.` so variables can be defined and exported.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh aarch64 compatible doghouse
  ```

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Test the aarch64 Build.</b></summary>

If your build environment is aarch64, you can test this build. Requires previously downloaded model to the `$MODELS_DIR` directory.
- View the script: <a href="../../scripts/510-Test-Cosmo-Build.sh" target="_blank">510-Test-Cosmo-Build.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Test-Cosmo-Build.sh aarch64 compatible 1 doghouse
  ```
</details>

### Assemble doghouse Actual Portable Executable (APE)
Now that we have x86_64 and aarch64 (ARM64) builds, we can assemble them into an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file.
- View the script: <a href="../../scripts/510-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh" target="_blank">510-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh</a>.
- Run the script:
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Assemble-Cosmo-APE.sh compatible doghouse

  ```

#### Test the Assembled APE
If your build environment is x86_64 or aarch64, you can test the assembled APE. Requires previously downloaded model to the `$MODELS_DIR` directory.
- View the script: <a href="../../scripts/510-Test-Cosmo-APE.sh" target="_blank">510-Test-Cosmo-APE.sh</a>.
- Run the script:
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Test-Cosmo-APE.sh compatible command-line 1 doghouse
  ```

### WSL Note
If you get build errors in the CMake preparation step, you most likely did not turn off interoperability in WSL. Please see instructions in [2021. Prepare WSL](201-Prepare-WSL.md).

You can turn off interoperability temporarily with this command:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop-late'
```

### SHORTCUT: Build and Assemble APE, Test APE
I really think you should run through these scripts one at a time the first few times you build, so you can familiarize yourself with the process and know what goes where. But, now that you've run through a few times, you can use the shortcut snippet:
```
################################################################################
# SHORTCUT: DON'T DO THIS IF YOU ALREADY RAN SCRIPTS ABOVE!
################################################################################
$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Build-with-Cosmo.sh X86_64 compatible doghouse

$MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/510-Test-Cosmo-APE.sh compatible command-line 1 doghouse
```
