## 610. Platform Packages

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT WORKING YET. -BRAD**

### About this Step
Let's prepare a `.zip` file containing a `doghouse` executable and a `doghouse-support` directory for distribution. You will start with one of the `doghouse` apps you built, add certificates, add a add a `.gguf` model file, and add a configuration file. You will test run it, zip it up, then copy it to your Mmojo Share. 

**TO-DO**:
- Incorporate .gguf short name into directory name, zip name.
- Shortcut after picking build and gguf.
- Choosing the build doesn't find GPU-enabled builds.
- Test localhost and public interfaces before copying to Mmojo Server.

### Choose a `doghouse` Build to Package
This script has you choose one of the `doghouse` apps you've built.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/mm-choose-build.sh" target="_blank">mm-choose-build.sh</a>.

    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script.
  ```
  unset CHOSEN_BUILD
  unset CHOSEN_BUILD_PATH
  unset CHOSEN_BUILD_INFO
  . mm-choose-build.sh
  ```

---
### Choose `.gguf` Model to Add to Package
Choose a model. The models from your `$HOME/300-MODELS` directory are available for you to use. This is its own script in your `$HOME/scripts` directory because it sets an environment variable and is resused in these instructions.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/mm-choose-model.sh" target="_blank">mm-choose-model.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  unset CHOSEN_MODEL
  unset CHOSEN_MODEL_MNEMONIC
  . mm-choose-model.sh
  ```

---
### Create Package Directories
This script creates the package directories.
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/610-Create-Package-Directories.sh" target="_blank">610-Create-Package-Directories.sh</a>.

  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/610-Create-Package-Directories.sh doghouse
  # Keep track of what we add below for the `default-args` file.
  unset ADDED_CERTS
  unset ADDED_MMOJO_COMPLETE
  unset ADDED_MODEL
  ```

  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/610-Add-Certs-to-Package.sh doghouse
  # Keep track of what we add for the `default-args` file.
  export ADDED_CERTS=1
  ```

*Note: I use these certificates in my Mmojo Knowledge Appliance. I will document why and how to create these certificates soon.*

    export ADDED_MODEL=1
  fi
  ```

---
### Add Args File to Package
