## 106. Contribute and Sponsor
### Contribute
This project is (mostly) a one man show. I do not accept or even evaluate unsolicited pull requests. Please start a discussion about a feature, discuss, and listen to feedback before implementing the feature and expecting it to be considered. The most important feature of any feature in Mmojo Server is maintainability. The second most important feature is understandability. To get a new feature in, code and documentation will be written in a style consistent with my own in this repo.

Like the project that inspired Mmojo Server, people will come to depend on Mmojo Server being maintained and up to date. If it can't be because too much expertise or time is required to do so, Mmojo Server will have failed. That's not happening with my product on my watch.

### Sponsor
If you'd like to sponsor my work financially, please email me. I offer build instructions for a branded version of Mmojo Server. A prototype is called **Doghouse**, which is North American English slang for "a disordely heap of people formed around one person whom the others jump." You can build it now by following the instructions to [200. Prepare the Build Environment](200-Prepare-Build-Environment.md) and [300. Gather Build Pieces](300-Gather-Build-Pieces.md), then jumping over to [500. Build Doghouse](doghouse/500-Build-Doghouse.md). Your sponsoring brand could have a cool open source LLM server too!
