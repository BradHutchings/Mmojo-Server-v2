## 302. Copy Models
### About this Step
In this step, we will copy models from the Mmojo Share. If you don't have and models to copy, you can build some from Hugging Face repos in a few steps.

**Where:** Perform this step in both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.

**Shortcut:** [Scroll down](#shortcut-copy-models).

  <summary><b>Update Local Mmojo Server Repo</b> &mdash; Expand if you haven't today.</summary>
  
Have you updated your local clone of the Mmojo Server Repo today? If not, run this first:
```
mm-update-local-mmojo-server-repo.sh
mm-env
```

### Create Models Directory
This script creates the `$MODELS_DIR` and adds a simple model map to it:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/301-Create-Models-Directory.sh" target="_blank">301-Create-Models-Directory.sh</a>.
  - *On Github, you may need to right-click and choose "Open link in new tab" to open the "View script" links in a new tab.*
    <br/>
    <br/>
- Run the script. We run with `.` so variables can be defined and exported.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/301-Create-Models-Directory.sh
  ```

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Download Model Map.</b></summary>

If you plan to create `mmojo-server-one` Actual Portable Executables (APEs) with embedded models, you should download some models that are tested to work with `mmojo-server`. We'll download a model map from Hugging Face.

This script downloads the model map from Hugging Face:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/301-Download-Model-Map.sh" target="_blank">301-Download-Model-Map.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/301-Download-Model-Map.sh
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Optional: Edit the Model Map.</b></summary>

All these models will take a long time to download, so you can edit the model map and remove models you don't want.
```
nano $MODEL_MAP
```
</details>

### Copy Models from Mmojo Share
If you've created a Mmojo share on your network, copying from that share is much faster than downloading from Hugging Face.

This script downloads the models from Hugging Face:
- View the script: <a href="../scripts/302-Copy-Models.sh" target="_blank">302-Copy-Models.sh</a>.
- Run the script.
  ```
  $MMOJO_SERVER_SCRIPTS/302-Copy-Models.sh
  ```

### SHORTCUT: Copy Models
I really think you should run through these scripts one at a time the first few times you build, so you can familiarize yourself with the process and know what goes where. But, now that you've run through a few times, you can use the shortcut snippet to copy two models I offer on Hugging Face from your Mmojo Share.
```

### SHORTCUT: Copy All Tested Models
I really think you should run through these scripts one at a time the first few times you build, so you can familiarize yourself with the process and know what goes where. But, now that you've run through a few times, you can use the shortcut snippet to copy all the models I offer on Hugging Face from your Mmojo Share. This will take awhile and use a lot (i.e. 100 GB-ish) of disk space.
