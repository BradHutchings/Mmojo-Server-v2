## 620. APE Packages
### About the Build llama-server Track
**llama-server** is the project upon which Mmojo Server builds. [Read more about llama-server](500-Build-llana-server.md).

---
### About this Step
In the following five steps, we will package llama-server for deployment as actual portable executables.
- **Compatible** builds run on a wide range of x86_64 and aarch64 processors.
- **Performant** builds run on newer x86_64 processors and Apple M* aarch64 processors.
- **Naked** means the APEs do not contain a `.gguf` file. One can be grafted on later using `zip` without modifying the `mmojo-server-args` file. You can also release a naked APE and have users copy the model they want to use into its directory.

**Where:** Perform these steps in either or both your x86_64 and your aarch64 (arm64) build environments.
