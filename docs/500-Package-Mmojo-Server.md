## 500. Package Mmojo Server
### About this Section
Now that you have Mmojo Server built as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file, a CPU optimized build for your build system, or a GPU-enabled build for your build system, you can package it for deployment.

(Figure out the naming convention. "Mmojo Server" is APE, "Mmojo Server (OS, Architecture)", "Mmojo Server (Device)")
