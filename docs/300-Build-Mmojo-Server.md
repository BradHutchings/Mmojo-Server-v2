### About this Section
We're ready to build `mmojo-server` executables. First, we'll build a native version for the build environment platfrom that can be used to test features and changes. Then, we'll build an Actually Portable Executable (APE) with Cosmopolitan that will run anywhere. After that, we'll build unoptimized linux builds for x86_64 and aarch64 (arm64) platforms, as well as optimized builds for specific devices like macOS and Raspberry Pi.
