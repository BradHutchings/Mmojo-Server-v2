## 105. Contributing
### Contributing
This project is (mostly) a one man show. I do not accept or even evaluate unsolicited pull requests. Please start a discussion about a feature, discuss, and listen to feedback before implementing the feature and expecting it to be considered. The most important feature of any feature in Mmojo Server is maintainability. The second most important feature is understandability. To get a new feature in, code and documentation will be written in a style consistent with my own in this repo.

Like the project that inspired Mmojo Server, people will come to depend on Mmojo Server being maintained and up to date. If it can't be because too much expertise or time is required to do so, Mmojo Server will have failed. That's not happening with my product on my watch.

If you'd like to sponsor my work financially, please email me.
